## Getting Started
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

+ Node.js (v14 or later)
+ npm (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js)
+ Git (If you don't have git on your machine, install it).
+ Fork this repository
+ Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.  
+ This will create a copy of this repository in your account (i.e Cloning the repository).


Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

````git clone ["url you just copied"](https://github.com/AdeGneus/hng_boilerplate_node_web.git)````

copy URL to clipboard
````
For example:

git clone git@github.com:AdeGneus/hng_boilerplate_node_web.git
Create a branch
Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

cd hng_boilerplate_node_web
Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

git checkout -b team_jopak.
````

Make Changes
Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.

### The following changes were made:

Boilerplate API Specification OpenAPI Spec file
Boilerplate API HTML link OpenAPI HTML link
Entity Relationship Diagram ERD design
Run Tests
Run the existing tests to ensure your changes do not break anything. If you added new functionality, write corresponding tests.

## npm run test
+ Commit those changes
+ Now open Contributors.md file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

## git status

If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:

Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command git push:
````
git push -u origin your-branch-name
replacing your-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.
````
If you get any errors while pushing, click here:
Submit your changes for review into Staging
If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.

create a pull request

Now submit the pull request.

submit pull request

Soon your changes will be merged into the staging branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
